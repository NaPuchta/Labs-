// the createFood function will be made here where a random location will
// be given from the sketch function


// run function here with the update and render functions inside

// the update function checks to see if the food is eaten by the Snake
// if so then the food will dissapear and re appear somewhere else
// most likely will use a function for the exception of the food

// the render function creates the cube of food and gives its dimensions
// food will be red in color

// perhaps create score function in here otherwise create a new js file that is specific
// to the score and adds score every time the food is eaten
// it might prove to be a little too complicated however if too many js files are 
// added and attempted to get strewn together
